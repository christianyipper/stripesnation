                    <p>Stripes Nation is a referee & sports photography brand which began as a passion project by Christian Yip, a web developer and graphics designer. Driven by his love for hockey, he created a brand that reflected the spirit and values of the officiating community. The logo, font, and icons were carefully designed to evoke the elements of the referee uniform and the game's fast-paced nature.</p>
